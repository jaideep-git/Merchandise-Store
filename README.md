## About The Project

I made an e-commerce store that sells various products related to TV shows. In this project, I worked on the backend as well as the front end. I have implemented my learnings from the course **Modern React with Redux** by Stephen Grinder in this project.


## Technologies I used

#### Backend Technologies

* **Express** for creating RESTful APIs and connecting to the server.
* **MongoDB** for storing data.
* **Mongoose** for MongoDB operations.
* **JSON Web Token** for Authentication. 
* **Stripe** For handling payments. 
* **Nodemailer** for sending emails to users.

#### Front-end Technologies

* **React** for UI/UX
* **Redux** for State Management.
* **Material UI** as a CSS framework. 
* **Axios** for data fetching.

## Project Features
* Users can create a new account or log in to the existing one. They can also reset the password by getting an email to their registered email address.
* After logging in, they can edit their profile information.
* Users can buy different products by going through a simple checkout process.
* Users can check their order details in the profile section.
* Users can also review the products.
* Admin has access to add new products to the store.
* Admin can check all users and order details.
* Admin can change order status. 

## Deployment
I have deployed my app on **Heroku** but my first choice was to deploy it on my personal server. Since c-panel doesn't support MongoDB that's why I deployed it on Heroku.
